# Flutterbooth
A Photobooth desktop application made with Flutter and using libgphoto2 

## Why
The reasons that led me to create this application were:
- The desire to discover Flutter through a relevant project
- The fact that I couldn't find an existing open-source application that met my needs

## Goal
The goal is to create a final application that is:
- Easy to install
- Usable without a touchscreen, with navigation controlled by three buttons (previous, next, confirm)
- Customizable
- And performs well
